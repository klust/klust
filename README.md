### Repository of Kurt Lust

I am working as an HPC consultatnt in the CalcUA supercomputer service of the University of Antwerp.
The CalcUA unit is part of the [VSC - Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum](https://www.vscentrum.be/).
I work part-time in the User Support Team of the [LUMI supercomputer](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/) project,
one of the EuroHPC pre-exascale supercomputers.

Most repositories under my account are clones of other repositories that are used to develop stuff before
submitting pull requests, or repositories that are temporary to try out new ideas before moving them
under the accounts of the organisations for which I work:

-   [hpcuantwerpen](https://github.com/hpcuantwerpen) which is the account for all CalcUA organisation
-   [lumi-supercomputer](https://github.com/lumi-supercomputer) which is the account for the LUMI project

I do have some original tutorials etc. in [my personal github.io space](https://klust.github.io/).
